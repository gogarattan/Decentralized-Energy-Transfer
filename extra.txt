We can sell energy to Indian Government at Rs.2 per unit and Government sells it back to customers at much higher cost Rs.5 per unit (Punjab).
Hence, our project removes Government (middleman) from selling and purchasing energy.


money deducted without sending to national grid = 0.11 ether (in form of gas)

energy purchased = 2.9 * 15 units = 43.5 units

money deducted with purchasing from national grid = 0.17 ether

increase in national grid account = 0.02 ether

1 gas = 2 * 10^-8 ether
